# Lisk Escrow Platform

A blockchain-based escrow platform for secure international trade transactions built on Lisk.

## 🚀 Overview

This platform enables trustless cross-border trade by holding funds in smart contract escrow until delivery is confirmed. Buyers create contracts, sellers fulfill them, and payments are automatically released upon successful delivery verification.

## 💼 Key Features

- **Secure Escrow**: Funds locked in smart contracts until delivery confirmed
- **Document Verification**: On-chain document hash storage for shipping proof
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, and email-based wallets
- **Real-time Updates**: Blockchain events indexed for instant UI updates
- **Simple Workflow**: Only 3 fields needed to create a contract

## 🔄 Transaction Flow

1. **Create** → Buyer initiates contract with seller's email
2. **Fund** → Buyer deposits IDRX into escrow
3. **Ship** → Seller uploads shipping documents
4. **Release** → Buyer confirms delivery and releases payment
